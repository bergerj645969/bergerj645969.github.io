        <p class="description">
            My studies in math and computer science at Oregon State University are guided by a simple yet powerful idea: to use technology to make a difference. I'm currently collaborating with team members at Oregon State's STAR lab to kick off a startup. Our goal is straightforward â€“ to use advanced language models to solve practical problems. This project, alongside my academic work, reflects my belief that blending the precision of math with the possibilities of technology can lead to real progress. I'm excited by the potential of AI to better our world, aiming to create technology that supports communities and improves everyday life.
