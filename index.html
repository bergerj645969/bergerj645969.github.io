        <h2 class="description">Hi, I'm Jacob Berger.</h2>
        <p class="description">
            At the heart of my math and computer science studies at Oregon State University is a drive to harness technology for societal benefit. I'm currently collaborating with colleagues from Oregon State's STAR lab to launch a startup that aims to leverage large language models to address real-world problems. This venture, along with my academic pursuits, underscores my belief in the synergy of computational innovation and mathematical principles as a catalyst for progress. I'm inspired by the promise of AI as a force for good, shaping a future where tech empowers communities and enhances daily life.
