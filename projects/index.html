<p>Here are some of the cool things I've worked on:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>COMAP 2023 Submission - Modeling Ecosystem Stability Under Climate Change</strong> - This project was submitted to the COMAP Mathematical Contest in Modeling, a rigorous four-day nationwide competition for college students. Competing under Oregon State University, my teammate and I developed mathematical models to assess the resilience of ecosystems to changes in precipitation influenced by climate change. We utilized both continuous and cellular automata methods, with my specific focus on the cellular automata model to analyze spatial dynamics and interactions within ecosystems. Our approach allowed us to explore ecosystem adaptability and stability, with our results validated through comparative analyses with continuous models, illustrated in detailed graphical time-series simulations. <a href="./documents/COMAP_2023.pdf">[Link to project]</a></li>
    <li><strong>Mathematical Modeling of Bowling Ball Dynamics for Practical On-Lane Performance</strong> - In this project, I developed a unique mathematical model from scratch, creating a system of differential equations to capture the dynamics of bowling balls on oiled lanes. This model simulates the intricate behaviors of ball roll, hook, and lane interaction, using Python to implement the equations and visualize ball trajectories. While it currently serves as a foundational tool for future refinement, it demonstrates potential applications in enhancing bowling strategies through simulated adjustments. This approach addresses a significant gap in current research and tooling, where high-end mathematical models often lack practical applicability for bowlers who have limited technical knowledge of their ball motion. <a href="./documents/Bowling_Modeling.pdf">[Link to project]</a></li>
