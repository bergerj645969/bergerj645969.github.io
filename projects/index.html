<p>Here are some of the cool things I've worked on:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>COMAP 2023 Submission - Modeling Ecosystem Stability Under Climate Change</strong> - This project was submitted to the COMAP Mathematical Contest in Modeling, a rigorous four-day nationwide competition for college students. Competing under Oregon State University, my teammate and I developed mathematical models to assess the resilience of ecosystems to changes in precipitation influenced by climate change. We utilized both continuous and cellular automata methods, with my specific focus on the cellular automata model to analyze spatial dynamics and interactions within ecosystems. Our approach allowed us to explore ecosystem adaptability and stability, with our results validated through comparative analyses with continuous models, illustrated in detailed graphical time-series simulations. <a href="./documents/COMAP_2023.pdf">[Link to project]</a></li>
    <li><strong>Mathematical Modeling of Bowling Ball Dynamics for Practical On-Lane Performance</strong> - This project bridges the gap between theoretical modeling and hands-on bowling strategy. Starting from the physical attributes of a bowling ball and the frictional properties of various oil patterns, I developed a detailed mathematical framework that bowlers and coaches can actually use to inform their approach on the lanes. By defining and calibrating parameters such as ball mass, friction coefficients, and oil volume fractions across boards, I derived a system of differential equations that realistically simulates how a ball rolls, hooks, and travels down the lane. Unlike many theoretical studies, the model’s outputs—including ball trajectory, entry angle, and response to changing conditions—offer insights bowlers can apply directly, helping them adjust release techniques, equipment choices, or targeting strategies. This rigorously tested model thus serves both as a research tool and a practical guide for improving on-lane performance. <a href="./documents/bowling_model.pdf">[Link to project]</a></li>
